As part of a very detailed conversation, the patient is encouraged to
to have it carried out, as well as the planned MRI.
We then ask you to send the MRI images, pre- and postoperative or post-zoladex and the
Improvement of the patient.
In the meantime, the patient should lead a pain diary with ongoing therapy in order to be clear
what is currently the main burden on the symptoms.
In principle, with good symptom control, the switch to a GnRH antagonist could either be either
with fixed addback therapy in the sense of Ryeqo or an antagonist with patient-cut
Addback therapy in the sense of YSSELTY.
